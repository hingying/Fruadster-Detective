# Fruadster-Detective

Fruadster Detective utilise artificial intelligence to simulate the benefits of dual system model for financial institutions in detecting credit card fraud transactions, both card-present and card-not-present.

This dual-system model consists of both supervised classifier and anomaly detector system. Using a training data set of 2 months and testing data of 1 months, we managed to reduce 2.4 millions suspicious transaction for human investigator to look up. This is beneficial especially to retail banks with extensive credit card offerings as the system could decrease their opportunity costs, allowing them to allocate their resources more efficiently and increase their margins.


## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is simulated following the guidelines in [Credit Crad Fraud Handbook](https://fraud-detection-handbook.github.io/fraud-detection-handbook/Foreword.html) written by Yann-AÃ«l Le Borgne and Gianluca Bontempi.
